# Pokemon Will Reroll

**A module for the Pokerole system in Foundry VTT**  
Adds the ability to reroll dice in rolls by spending **Will points** of the Pokémon or Trainer.

> ✅ Works with **Foundry V13-v14**  
> 📦 **Manifest for installation:**  
> `https://github.com/Joberl-lab/pokemon-will-reroll/releases/latest/download/module.json`

## How the Module Works

### 1. Reroll Button Appearance
After any roll in the Pokerole chat, the module checks the message and, if it finds dice values (numbers from 1 to 6), adds a button **«Würfel neu werfen»** (reroll dice) below the message.

The button appears only if:
- the message has an associated actor (Pokémon),
- the current user is the **GM** or **owner** of that actor.

### 2. Selecting Dice to Reroll
When the button is clicked, a dialog window opens showing all unsuccesful dice, which you may click to reroll by spending will points. If "Allow all dice reroll" setting is on, window contains:
- all dice from the roll,
- **green** highlights for successes (value ≥ 4),
- **red** highlights for failures (value < 4).

The player can **select any dice** (successes can also be rerolled if the corresponding setting is enabled).

### 3. Spending Will Points
Each rerolled die costs **1 Will point**.

Sources of Will (in order of priority):
1. **The Pokémon's own Will** – spent first.
2. **Trainer's Will** – if the Pokémon lacks enough points and the setting allows using trainer Will.

If there are not enough Will points from either source, the reroll is cancelled and a warning is shown.

### 4. Updating the Chat Message
After a successful reroll:
- old dice values are replaced with new ones,
- the chat message is updated,
- if the **«showWillMessage»** setting is enabled, a system message about spent Will is sent to chat.

### 5. Visual Marker
Messages that have already been rerolled receive a **golden border** – this helps GMs and players see that the roll has been modified.

### 6. Pushing Fate option
Add one or more successes for rolls, without deleting it.
